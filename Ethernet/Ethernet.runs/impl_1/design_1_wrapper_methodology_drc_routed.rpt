TIMING-25#1 Warning
Invalid clock waveform on gigabit transceiver (GT)  
The waveform of the user clock design_1_i/axi_ethernet_0/U0/pcs_pma/U0/pcs_pma_block_i/transceiver_inst/gtwizard_inst/U0/gtwizard_i/gt0_GTWIZARD_i/gtxe2_i/RXOUTCLK defined on the transceiver output pin design_1_i/axi_ethernet_0/U0/pcs_pma/U0/pcs_pma_block_i/transceiver_inst/gtwizard_inst/U0/gtwizard_i/gt0_GTWIZARD_i/gtxe2_i/RXOUTCLK or on the net connected to that pin is not consistent with the transceiver settings. The auto-derived clock period is UNDEFINED and the user-defined clock period is 16.000. The expected clock waveform is computed based on the GT settings and the incoming clock to the transceiver. It is recommended to check that there are no missing clocks to the GT and that all the transceiver settings are correct
